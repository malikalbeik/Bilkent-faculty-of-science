                <h3>Democracy and Non-communicable Diseases</h3>
                <p>Dr. Simon Wigley &ndash; Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; The global health community has historically prioritized communicable diseases and child mortality
                    over non-communicable diseases and injuries. Non-communicable diseases are now the leading cause
                    of death in the world. In addition, the disease burden is shifting rapidly from communicable to
                    non-communicable diseases in low and middle-income countries. Global health donors and
                    intergovernmental institutions have also tended to prioritize the intellectual and material resources
                    needed to prevent premature death, over the incentives and capacity of local governments to
                    efectively use those resources. Do the mechanisms through which political leaders are selected matter
                    when it comes to population health? Previous studies on the relationship between democracy and
                    health have focused almost exclusively on child mortality. In our Lancet study we examine the
                    relationship between democratic institutions and cause-specific mortality. Using a variety of methods
                    and a panel of 170 countries for more than 25 years we find that democratic experience - a measure of
                    how democratic a country has been, and for how long - explains more of the variance in mortality due
                    to cardiovascular diseases, transport injuries, cancers, cirrhosis, and other non-communicable diseases
                    than GDP. Between 1995 and 2015, we estimate that increases in democratic experience averted 16
                    million deaths from cardiovascular diseases globally. This suggests that the institutions required to
                    ensure accountability and responsiveness between citizens and political leaders is a key factor when it
                    comes to the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases.

                <h3>History of Black Holes</h3>
                <p>Prof. Dr. Metin G&#252;rses</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; Scientists pictured a black hole for the first time in 
great detail. This was achieved through a
                    global network of radio dishes called &quot;The Event Horizon Telescope&quot; and produced the the first-ever
                    direct image of a black hole. The existence of black holes was first proposed by physicists nearly a
                    century ago following Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, but 
the evidence was indirect. The
                    Event Horizon Telescope now confirmed theoretical predictions and once more demonstrated that &quot;a
                    picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. There are more than one black holes in the universe and the attention
                    of astrophysicist was concentrated on M87 and Sagittarius A* since 2017. The first clean picture came
                    from M87 and it took two years to put together the data. It is now possible to observe that M87 is
                    spinning clockwise in the sky. Scientists are now studying to understand how the black hole produces it
                    gigantic jets.

                <h3>How to Shake Empty Space</h3>
                <p>Dr. Fethi M&#252;bin Ramazano&#287;lu - Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; Einstein taught us a century ago that if you move any 
mass, you 
can actually distort space and time, and generate little travelling vibrations called gravitational waves. What is there to vibrate in "empty" space? We will start with a non-technical history of gravity that culminates in Einstein's theory of general relativity to understand the nature of space and time. We will then examine the generation of gravitational waves by various astrophysical systems, their detection using the most sensitive interferometers on Earth, and what we can learn from their analysis. Aside from giving us a new tool to observe the universe, gravitational wave detectors also have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.  
                    <br>
                    Fethi M&#252;bin Ramazano&#287;lu obtained his doctoral degree from Princeton University in 2012. After postdoctoral positions at Princeton University and the University of Cambridge, he has been on the faculty of Ko&#231; University since 2015. His research is focused on gravitational physics with particular emphasis on strongly gravitating systems, gravitational waves and numerical relativity.

                <p>Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mehmet &#214;zg&#252;r Oktel &ndash; Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; The 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 
                    to J. Michael Kosterlitz, 
                    Duncan Haldane, and David J. Thouless, for "theoretical discoveries 
                    of topological phase 
                    transitions and topological phases of matter. In this talk I will try 
                    to explain why Topology, 
                    a branch of geometry which studies properties which do not change with continuous changes in 
                    size or shape, becomes important in determining the physical properties of a system and phase 
                    transitions between different states of matter. Without presenting any mathematical details, I 
                    will motivate the order parameter concept and its connection to topological defects. I will try 
                    to review some of the concepts regarding Kosterlitz Thouless phase transitions, Thouless charge 
                    pumps, Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs conductance formula, Haldane gap in spin chains and 
                    the Haldane model. Finally I would like to review current status of the field, including our recent 
                    work[1]. The talk is aimed at a broad audience with minimal background in mathematics and physics, 
                    and should be acessible to undergraduate students.[1] F. Nur &#220;nal, Erich J. Mueller, and

                <h3>Towards Precision Medicine in Understudied Global Populations - The Qatar Experience</h3>
                <p>Dr. Khalid Fakhro - Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; Achieving "prsonalized medicicne" will 
                    ultimately depend on the quality and speed of genome
                    interpretation, tailored to individuals in the context of their native populations. Over the past
                    5 years in Qatar there have been signicant advances in this area, driven by initial explorations
                    of population genetic structure to recent identication of disease-causing genes and loci underlying both
                    rare (Mendelian) disease and complex traits, such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. To date,
                    we have sequenced nearly 2,000 Qataris for a variety of population-level and disease studies, and have demonstrated
                    the signicant under-appreciated diversity of modern day Arabs, as well as identied founder alleles for a variety of dierent
                    diseases relevant to the local population. Our data motivate the launch of the recent Qatar Genome Program, a multi-stakeholder,
                    nation-wide eort to sequence all native Qataris over the coming decade. To date, this program has sequenced almost 10,000 whole 
                    genomes, and is preparing to explore bio-banked samples on the same individuals using a variety of state-of-the-art omics approaches. 
                    This talk will cover the trajectory that genome sciences has taken in Qatar over recent years and invite collaborations for the future, to 
                    deliver on the promise of using next generation tools to unravel human biology, and arrive at precision healthcare.

                <p>Prof. Dr. Engin U. Akkaya and Asst. Prof. Dr. Bilge Baytekin &ndash; Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; The laws of motion for our world, and that of molecules are different. 
                    As a consequence, a molecule-based machine is not likely to be a miniaturized 
                    version of a macroscopic machine. This year's Chemistry Nobel laureates illuminated 
                    the path towards functional molecular machines.  Jean-Pierre Sauvage and Sir J. Fraser 
                    Stoddart showed their mastery of "interlocked" molecules for controlling relative motions 
                    of their constituent parts.  Ben Feringa, on the other hand, focused on unidirectional movement 
                    of molecules. While inspired by nature (ATP synthase, flagellar motor, ribosome) the progress in 
                    molecular machines has been largely independent of our understanding of protein-based natural 
                    examples. In fact, their potential, not being constrained by evolutionary pressure, is much greater.
                    In the second part of the presentation, we will take a personal look, and try to understand what it 
                    takes to be a Nobel science laureate and imagine the life of the laureates after that phone call 
                    from Nobel Committee. Considering the clout that it comes with, we will also try to find out whether 
                    that power and prestige always put to good use -or not. We will consider a few cases of close interest.

                <h3>Genomic landscape of the Mediterranean basin and beyond</h3>
                <p>Prof. Dr. Tayfun &#214;z&#231;elik - Conference</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; Scientists reported the genomic landscape of the Mediterranean 
                    basin and the Greater Middle East, a central hub for ancient civilizations 
                    and home to approximately 10 percent of the World population, in an article 
                    published in the September 2016 issue of Nature Genetics1. Project results 
                    provide important insights into two major areas of human genetics, namely the 
                    identification of disease-associated genes and the elucidation of the human 
                    migration pathways from Africa to Asia and Europe. The high consanguinity rates, 
                    a characteristic of Middle Eastern populations, enhance disease gene identification 
                    by 4 to 7 fold. The Project was first proposed by Dr. Tayfun &#214;z&#231;elik from the 
                    Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and an international group of 
                    scientists who convened at Bilkent University in 2009 and 20102-4. More than 
                    180 scientists from Algeria, Egypt, France, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, 
                    Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United 
                    Arab Emirates and United States contributed to the project. Rockefeller, Harvard, 
                    MIT, California, Cornell, INSERM, Alfaisal and &#304;stanbul Universities were amongst 
                    the partners. In his presentation, Dr. &#214;z&#231;elik will discuss the implication of

                <h3>Reprogramming and its application in Rett Syndrome</h3>
                <p>Do&#231;. Dr. In-Hyun Park - Seminar </p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT &ndash; Overexpression of four factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Myc, 
                    or Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Lin28) reprogram somatic cells to become 
                    induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Reprogramming accompanies 
                    genetic and epigenetic changes. We will investigate the molecular 
                    mechanism of somatic cell reprogramming. iPSCs provide an incredible 
                    resource for cell-based theraphy, in vitro disease model and screening 
                    drugs. We apply the iPSCs to investigate one of the most prevalent 
                    female mental retardation disorders called Rett syndrome.

                <h3>Targeting Chemokines in Atherosclerosis</h3>
                <p>Prof. Dr. Christian Weber</p>
                <p>
                    Coronary artery disease arising from atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death 
                    and morbidity worldwide. The underlying pathogenesis involves an imbalanced lipid 
                    metabolism and a maladaptive immune response entailing a chronic inflammation of 
                    the arterial wall. The disturbed equilibrium of lipid accumulation, immune responses 
                    and their clearance is shaped by leukocyte trafficking and homeostasis governed by 
                    chemokines and their receptors. New pro- and anti- inflammatory pathways linking lipid 
                    and inflammation biology have been discovered, and genetic profiling studies have 
                    unveiled variations involved in human atherosclerosis. The growing understanding of 
                    the inflammatory processes and mediators has uncovered an intriguing diversity of 
                    targetable mechanisms that can be exploited to complement lipid-lowering therapies. 
                    In their role as small chemotactic cytokines, chemokines are crucial mediators and regulators 
                    of leukocyte trafficking during immune surveillance and inflammation. Their involvement in 
                    the development and progression of inflammatory diseases has been subject of intense 
                    investigation. Concordantly, the chemokine system of ligands and receptors has been 
                    explored in search for therapeutic targets to prevent or treat atherosclerosis. 
                    Targeting the chemokine system e.g. by disrupting functional heteromer formation 
                    or modulating the microRNA-mediated regulation of chemokine expression, offers 
                    various entry points for a causative treatment of this widespread and chronic illness. 
                    Although the approach of directly targeting chemokine receptors has encountered some 
                    setbacks, several innovative compounds are currently in an advanced stage of development. 
                    Herein, the current standing of this dynamic field is highlighted and the potential 
                    advantages and drawbacks of particular strategies are discussed.

                <h3>Anna Karenina and the Genetics of Complex Disease</h3>
                <p>Dr. Mary-Claire King</p>
                <p>
                    New tools of genomic analysis are being used to shed light on historical 
                    puzzles. Migrations of ancient peoples, the effects of geographic boundaries 
                    on human movements, origins of ethnic groups, and racial differences are 
                    now the focus of integrated analysis by historians, anthropologists and 
                    geneticists. "When people move, they take their genes along and pass them 
                    on to their descendants in their new homes," Dr. Mary-Claire King states. 
                    "Thus, every present-day population retains clues to its ancient roots. 
                    Common ancestries can be confirmed and human migrations traced by comparing 
                    DNA sequences of present-day populations."

                <p>Dr. Eran Halperin</p>
                <p>
                    How much can we learn about a person based on his or her DNA?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Can we find the individual's place of birth, last name, or family members? 
                    With the exponential decrease in the cost of DNA sequencing, it is now 
                    possible to begin answering some of these questions. In this talk I will 
                    describe recent developments in computational methods for the detection of 
                    an individual's ancestry from genetic data. I will also discuss implications 
                    to privacy of genetic information and the role of public databases in human 
                    identification from genetic data.

                <h3>Wild World of 4-Manifolds</h3>
                <p>Prof. Dr. Selman Akbulut</p>
                <p>
                    Four dimensional smooth manifolds (generalized Euclidean spaces) display 
                    very strange behavior than manifolds in any other dimensions. Four is also 
                    the dimension of the space-time, which physicist think as a part of a bigger 
                    11-dimensional universe. In this talk, I will review some recent developments 
                    of 4-manifolds, in particular discuss corks and plugs, which are small 
                    fundamental pieces floating in smooth 4-manifolds determining their smooth 
                    structure (twisting along them changes smooth structure), and talk about 
                    exotic structures on complex Stein surfaces.

                <h3>Nobel Prize in Physics 2012: Unlocking Quantum Mysteries one particle at a time </h3>
                <p>Dr. Mehmet &#214;zg&#252;r Oktel</p>
                <p>
                    The 2012 Nobel prize in physics was awarded to Serge Haroche 
                    (ENS, Paris, France) and David J. Wineland (JILA, CO, USA) for 
                    their contributions to " ground-breaking experimental methods 
                    that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum 
                    systems". These two groups spearheaded the effort to probe quantum 
                    mechanics by examining physics of single atoms or single photons.  
                    I will review some of the milestones of their achievements such as 
                    quantum non-demolition measurements, creation of Schr&#246;dinger Cat states, 
                    and the controlled quantum-not gate.  The emphasis of the talk will be 
                    on these key results and what they teach us about basic quantum mechanics, 
                    rather than on the experimental techniques. Finally, I will discuss the 
                    potential applications of these results, such as improved frequency 
                    standards and quantum computers.
