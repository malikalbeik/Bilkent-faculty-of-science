                <h3>Democracy and Non-communicable Diseases</h3>
                <p>Dr. Simon Wigley – Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — The global health community has historically prioritized communicable diseases and child mortality
                    over non-communicable diseases and injuries. Non-communicable diseases are now the leading cause
                    of death in the world. In addition, the disease burden is shifting rapidly from communicable to
                    non-communicable diseases in low and middle-income countries. Global health donors and
                    intergovernmental institutions have also tended to prioritize the intellectual and material resources
                    needed to prevent premature death, over the incentives and capacity of local governments to
                    efectively use those resources. Do the mechanisms through which political leaders are selected matter
                    when it comes to population health? Previous studies on the relationship between democracy and
                    health have focused almost exclusively on child mortality. In our Lancet study we examine the
                    relationship between democratic institutions and cause-specific mortality. Using a variety of methods
                    and a panel of 170 countries for more than 25 years we find that democratic experience - a measure of
                    how democratic a country has been, and for how long - explains more of the variance in mortality due
                    to cardiovascular diseases, transport injuries, cancers, cirrhosis, and other non-communicable diseases
                    than GDP. Between 1995 and 2015, we estimate that increases in democratic experience averted 16
                    million deaths from cardiovascular diseases globally. This suggests that the institutions required to
                    ensure accountability and responsiveness between citizens and political leaders is a key factor when it
                    comes to the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases.

                <h3>History of Black Holes</h3>
                <p>Prof. Metin G&#252;rses</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — Scientists pictured a black hole for the first time in great detail. This was achieved through a
                    global network of radio dishes called &quot;The Event Horizon Telescope&quot; and produced the the first-ever
                    direct image of a black hole. The existence of black holes was first proposed by physicists nearly a
                    century ago following Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, but the evidence was indirect. The
                    Event Horizon Telescope now confirmed theoretical predictions and once more demonstrated that &quot;a
                    picture is worth a thousand words&quot;. There are more than one black holes in the universe and the attention
                    of astrophysicist was concentrated on M87 and Sagittarius A* since 2017. The first clean picture came
                    from M87 and it took two years to put together the data. It is now possible to observe that M87 is
                    spinning clockwise in the sky. Scientists are now studying to understand how the black hole produces it
                    gigantic jets.

                <h3>How to Shake Empty Space</h3>
                <p>Dr. Fethi M&#252;bin Ramazano&#287;lu - Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — Einstein taught us a century ago that if you move any mass, you can actually distort space and time, and generate little travelling vibrations called gravitational waves. What is there to vibrate in "empty" space? We will start with a non-technical history of gravity that culminates in Einstein's theory of general relativity to understand the nature of space and time. We will then examine the generation of gravitational waves by various astrophysical systems, their detection using the most sensitive interferometers on Earth, and what we can learn from their analysis. Aside from giving us a new tool to observe the universe, gravitational wave detectors also have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.  
                    <br>
                    Fethi M&#252;bin Ramazano&#287;lu obtained his doctoral degree from Princeton University in 2012. After postdoctoral positions at Princeton University and the University of Cambridge, he has been on the faculty of Ko&#231; University since 2015. His research is focused on gravitational physics with particular emphasis on strongly gravitating systems, gravitational waves and numerical relativity.

                <p>Assoc. Prof. Dr. Mehmet &#214;zg&#252;r Oktel – Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — Achieving “personalized medicine” will ultimately depend on the quality and speed of genome
                    interpretation, tailored to individuals in the context of their native populations. Over the past
                    5 years in Qatar there have been signicant advances in this area, driven by initial explorations
                    of population genetic structure to recent identication of disease-causing genes and loci underlying both
                    rare (Mendelian) disease and complex traits, such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. To date,
                    we have sequenced nearly 2,000 Qataris for a variety of population-level and disease studies, and have demonstrated
                    the signicant under-appreciated diversity of modern day Arabs, as well as identied founder alleles for a variety of dierent
                    diseases relevant to the local population. Our data motivate the launch of the recent Qatar Genome Program, a multi-stakeholder,
                    nation-wide eort to sequence all native Qataris over the coming decade. To date, this program has sequenced almost 10,000 whole 
                    genomes, and is preparing to explore bio-banked samples on the same individuals using a variety of state-of-the-art ‘omics approaches. 
                    This talk will cover the trajectory that genome sciences has taken in Qatar over recent years and invite collaborations for the future, to 
                    deliver on the promise of using next generation tools to unravel human biology, and arrive at precision healthcare.

                <h3>Towards Precision Medicine in Understudied Global Populations - The Qatar Experience</h3>
                <p>Dr. Khalid Fakhro - Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — The 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to J. Michael Kosterlitz, 
                    Duncan Haldane, and David J. Thouless, for “theoretical discoveries of topological phase 
                    transitions and topological phases of matter”. In this talk I will try to explain why Topology, 
                    a branch of geometry which studies properties which do not change with continuous changes in 
                    size or shape, becomes important in determining the physical properties of a system and phase 
                    transitions between different states of matter. Without presenting any mathematical details, I 
                    will motivate the order parameter concept and its connection to topological defects. I will try 
                    to review some of the concepts regarding Kosterlitz Thouless phase transitions, Thouless charge 
                    pumps, Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs conductance formula, Haldane gap in spin chains and 
                    the Haldane model. Finally I would like to review current status of the field, including our recent 
                    work[1]. The talk is aimed at a broad audience with minimal background in mathematics and physics, 
                    and should be acessible to undergraduate students. [1] F. Nur Ünal, Erich J. Mueller, and

                <p>Prof. Dr. Engin U. Akkaya and Asst. Prof. Dr. Bilge Baytekin – Seminar</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — The laws of motion for our world, and that of molecules are different. 
                    As a consequence, a molecule-based machine is not likely to be a miniaturized 
                    version of a macroscopic machine. This year’s Chemistry Nobel laureates illuminated 
                    the path towards functional molecular machines.  Jean-Pierre Sauvage and Sir J. Fraser 
                    Stoddart showed their mastery of “interlocked” molecules for controlling relative motions 
                    of their constituent parts.  Ben Feringa, on the other hand, focused on unidirectional movement 
                    of molecules. While inspired by nature (ATP synthase, flagellar motor, ribosome) the progress in 
                    molecular machines has been largely independent of our understanding of protein-based natural 
                    examples. In fact, their potential, not being constrained by evolutionary pressure, is much greater.
                    In the second part of the presentation, we will take a personal look, and try to understand what it 
                    takes to be a Nobel science laureate and imagine the life of the laureates after that phone call 
                    from Nobel Committee. Considering the clout that it comes with, we will also try to find out whether 
                    that power and prestige always put to good use -or not. We will consider a few cases of close interest.

                <p>Prof. Dr. Tayfun &#214;z&#231;elik - Conference</p>
                <p>
                    ABSTRACT — Scientists reported the genomic landscape of the Mediterranean 
                    basin and the Greater Middle East, a central hub for ancient civilizations 
                    and home to approximately 10 percent of the World population, in an article 
                    published in the September 2016 issue of Nature Genetics1. Project results 
                    provide important insights into two major areas of human genetics, namely the 
                    identification of disease-associated genes and the elucidation of the human 
                    migration pathways from Africa to Asia and Europe. The high consanguinity rates, 
                    a characteristic of Middle Eastern populations, enhance disease gene identification 
                    by 4 to 7 fold. The Project was first proposed by Dr. Tayfun &#214;z&#231;elik from the 
                    Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics and an international group of 
                    scientists who convened at Bilkent University in 2009 and 20102-4. More than 
                    180 scientists from Algeria, Egypt, France, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, 
                    Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United 
                    Arab Emirates and United States contributed to the project. Rockefeller, Harvard, 
                    MIT, California, Cornell, INSERM, Alfaisal and &#304;stanbul Universities were amongst 
                    the partners. In his presentation, Dr. &#214;z&#231;elik will discuss the implication of 
                    this project and propose a new disease gene identification scheme called 
                    “reverse phenotyping”, which was published as a “news and views” article5 
                    in the same issue of Nature Genetics.

                    induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Reprogramming accompanies 
                    genetic and epigenetic changes. We will investigate the molecular 
                    mechanism of somatic cell reprogramming. iPSCs provide an incredible 
                    resource for cell-based theraphy, in vitro disease model and screening 
                    drugs. We apply the iPSCs to investigate one of the most prevalent 
                    female mental retardation disorders called Rett syndrome.
